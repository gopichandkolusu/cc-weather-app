## Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app, which upon load, asks user for permission to load GeoLocation and displays weather relating to user's location.

Should the user deny access to auto-detect location, the user is presented with the option to manually add in any location coordinates or select from 2,000 list of Cities around the world to see weather report.
